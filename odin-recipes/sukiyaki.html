    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Sukiyaki Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 servings udon noodles (6.3 oz/180 g dry udon noodles; 1.1 lb/500 g
        frozen or parboiled udon noodles; the udon is eaten at the end of the

      <li>½ head napa cabbage (10 leaves; 1.8 lb or 690 g)</li>
      <li>½ bunch shungiku (chrysanthemum greens) (7 oz, 200 g)</li>
      <li>
        1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) (1 leek or 3 green onions)
      </li>
      <li>1 package enoki mushrooms (7 oz, 200 g)</li>
      <li>8 shiitake mushrooms (or other kinds of mushrooms)</li>

        1 package shirataki noodles (7 oz, 198 g; or cellophane/yam noodles)
      </li>
      <li>1 lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or rib eye) (slice your own meat)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For cooking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.) (or
        suet, if your sukiyaki beef package comes with it)
      </li>
      <li>1 Tbsp brown sugar (we use it for the first batch of meat)</li>
      <li>
        1-1½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more) (or water; to
        dilute the sauce)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Sukiyaki Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup sake</li>
      <li>1 cup mirin</li>
      <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To make the Sukiyaki Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the sake, mirin, sugar, and soy sauce in a small saucepan and
        bring it to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and set it aside.
        This Sukiyaki Sauce can be stored in an airtight container in the
        refrigerator for up to a month.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To prepare the ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If your udon noodles are frozen or parboiled, blanch them in boiling
        water until loosened. If using dry udon noodles, cook them according to
        the package directions. In either case, remove the cooked udon from the
        heat, drain, and soak in iced water to stop the cooking. Drain, transfer
        to a plate, and cover with plastic. You will not need it until the end
        of the sukiyaki meal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the sukiyaki ingredients. Cut the napa cabbage 2 inches (5 cm)
        wide, then cut the pieces in half down along the thick white center of
        the leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the shungiku 2 inches (5 cm) wide and slice the Tokyo negi
        diagonally. Discard the bottom part of the enoki bunch and tear it into
        smaller bundles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discard the shiitake stems and make decorative cuts in the shiitake caps
        if you'd like
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the tofu into smaller pieces (I usually cut it into 6-8 pieces).
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’d like, you can slice some carrots and then stamp them with a
        vegetable cutter into a floral shape for decoration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse and drain the shirataki noodles. Put all the ingredients on one
        big platter for the table.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To Cook the Sukiyaki</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set a portable gas cooktop at the dining table. Each person should have
        a medium-sized bowl where they can transfer the cooked food from the
        pot. Heat a cast-iron sukiyaki pot (or any pot) on medium heat. When
        it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp cooking oil (or the suet).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 2-4 slices of well-marbled beef in the pot to sear and sprinkle 1
        Tbsp brown sugar on top. Flip and cook the other side of the meat. I
        recommend that you pour a little bit of the sukiyaki sauce over the meat
        and enjoy some (or all) of the sweet and caramelized meat now to consume
        this good-quality beef at its best. Or you can leave the meat in the pot
        and continue to the next step.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The First Round of Sukiyaki</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour half of the sukiyaki sauce you made (1⅓ cups) and 1 cup dashi (or
        water) into the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the vegetables, tofu, and other ingredients to the pot (keep the
        udon for later). The ingredients should be partially submerged in the
        broth, about two-thirds of the way; add more sauce or dashi (or water)
        if necessary. Put the lid on and bring it to a gentle boil. Once
        boiling, turn down the heat and simmer until the ingredients are cooked
        through. At this point, you can add more beef, as it cooks fast.
        Transfer the cooked ingredients to the individual bowls and enjoy the
        first round of sukiyaki. If the cooking broth gets too salty due to
        evaporation, add more dashi (or water) to dilute. If the vegetables have
        diluted the broth too much, then add more sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The Second/Third Round of Sukiyaki</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When there is less cooked food in the pot, divide the leftovers into the
        individual bowls. Then start cooking the second round by adding more
        ingredients to the pot (repeat the previous step). While the second
        round of sukiyaki is cooking, you can enjoy eating the second portion
        from the first round or any side dishes. Cook a third round of sukiyaki
        to finish any uncooked ingredients that remain.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To End the Meal</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We usually end the sukiyaki meal with udon. When most of the ingredients
        have disappeared, add the prepared udon to the remaining broth in the
        pot. Cook until heated through and enjoy.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To Store</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>
            You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the
            refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for a month. Tofu does not
            freeze well, so remove it before freezing the leftovers.
          </li>
    </ol>
